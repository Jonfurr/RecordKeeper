# RecordKeeper
Our App is Called Record keeper, the purpose of the app is to allow users to keep track of their record collection. They do this by filling out a form and entering the information for each of the records they own. To do this, a user must create an account. Users are able to see other albums uploaded by other users and checkout other user profiles and collections. To access this feature a user must have an account or be logged in. A user just checking out the site can only view recently uploaded albums and along with album pages.

Before starting the actual coding process we took time to plan out what models we thought would be needed. We created our ERDS and wireframe of how we wanted the site to look on the whiteboard. We also wrote out our user stories on pivotal tracker. 

To build our application we utilized Ruby on Rails framework and library along with Postgresql to manage our database. To build our basic user structure we used a gem called sorcery. Sorcery helped us complete login, logout, and authentication functionality. We used bootstrap with html and css to create the styling of the application and give the user a mobile friendly site.Github and git were used to manage version control,and keep track of changes. In order to deploy a live site, we connected our repository to Heroku.

Unsolved problems/issues TBD.
